If you no longer wish to receive email communications for marketing purposes, please contact us to opt-out or click the unsubscribe link within the email.

<p><strong>5. Legal basis for processing your personal information</strong>

<p>We will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use your personal information. In almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following:<br>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consent:</strong> For example, where you have provided your consent to receive certain marketing from us. You can withdraw your consent at any time, including by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any marketing email we send you.</li>
<li><strong>Our legitimate business interests:</strong> Where it is necessary for us to understand our customers, promote our services and operate effectively provided in each case that this is done in a legitimate way which does not unduly affect your privacy and other rights. For example, we will rely on this legal basis when we conduct certain market analysis to understand our customers in sufficient detail so we can create new services and improve the profile of our brand.</li>
<li><strong>Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you):</strong> For example, where you have purchased a product from us and we need to use your contact details and payment information in order to process your order and send the product to you.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with law:</strong> Where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.</li>
</ul>

<br><strong>6. Disclosure of personal data</strong>

<p>We make certain personal data available to strategic partners that work with us to provide our products and services or help us market to customers. Personal data will only be shared by us with these companies in order to provide or improve our products, services, and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their own marketing purposes without your prior express consent.

<p>We may disclose your personal information to other third parties in the following cases:

<p><ul>
<li>for the purposes of research, evaluation, and analysis;</li>
<li>in the event that we sell any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective buyer of such business or assets;</li>
<li>if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us about our customers and visitors to our websites will be one of the transferred assets;</li>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request; or</li>
<li>to protect the rights, property or safety of us or our users, or others, and in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions (this includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).</li>
</ul>

<br><strong>7. Data storage and transfer</strong>

<p>The personal information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA or the UK, including countries, which have less strict, or no data protection laws, when compared to those in the EEA or the UK. Whenever we transfer your information in this way, we will take steps which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and to make sure it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice. In these cases, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (such as standard contractual clauses) to ensure your information is subject to adequate safeguards in the recipient country. If you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your personal information and privacy rights in these circumstances.

<p><strong>8. Your rights</strong>

<p>You have certain rights in relation to your personal information. These include: the right to object to the processing of your information for certain purposes, the right to access your personal information, and the ability to erase, restrict or receive a machine-readable copy of your personal information.<br>We will handle any request to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable law and any relevant legal exemptions. If you wish to exercise any of these rights please contact us using the contact details below.

<p>You may also lodge a complaint with the UK’s data protection authority (the ICO) regarding the processing of your personal data if you think we have processed your personal information in a manner which is unlawful or breaches your rights. If you have such concerns we request that you initially contact us (using the contact details below) so that we can investigate, and hopefully resolve, your concerns.

<p><strong>9. Third-party websites and services</strong>

<p>When a customer operates a link to a third-party website that has a relationship with us, we do not assume any obligation or responsibility for such policy because of the third party's privacy policy. Our websites, products, and services may contain links to or the ability for you to access third-party websites, products, and services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those third parties, nor are we responsible for the information or content their products and services contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to data collected by us through our products and services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third party before proceeding to use their websites, products, or services.

<p><strong>10. Data retention</strong>

<p>We take steps to ensure that the personal information that you provide is retained for only as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. After this period it will be deleted or in some cases anonymized unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

<p><strong>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>

<p>We may periodically change this Privacy Policy to keep pace with new technologies, industry practices, and regulatory requirements, among other reasons. The new privacy notice will be displayed on our website and app.
