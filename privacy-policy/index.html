<h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

<p><b>Personal information you disclose to us</b></p>

<p>In Short: We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>

<p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>

<p><b>Personal Information Provided by You.</b> The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>names</li>
  <li>phone numbers</li>
  <li>email addresses</li>
  <li>usernames</li>
  <li>passwords</li>
  <li>contact or authentication data</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Data Collected During Transactions.</b> When you make a purchase, we may also collect:</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>mailing addresses</li>
    <li>billing addresses</li>
    <li>debit/credit card numbers</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

<h3>Information automatically collected</h3>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b></i> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics—is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</p>

<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

<p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our <a href="/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>:</p>

<p>The information we collect includes:</p>

<p>• Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</p>

<p>• Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</p>

<p>• Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
</p>

<h3>Google API</h3>

<p>Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use">Limited Use requirements</a>.</p>



<h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</i></p>

<p><b>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><b>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.</b> We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.</li>
  <li><b>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.</b> We may process your information to respond to your inquiries and solve any potential issues you might have with the requested service.</li>
  <li><b>To send administrative information to you.</b> We may process your information to send you details about our products and services, changes to our terms and policies, and other similar information.</li>
  <li><b>To fulfill and manage your orders.</b> We may process your information to fulfill and manage your orders, payments, returns, and exchanges made through the Services.</li>
  <li><b>To enable user-to-user communications.</b> We may process your information if you choose to use any of our offerings that allow for communication with another user.</li>
  <li><b>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</b> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual's vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</i></p>

<p><b><i>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</i></b></p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. To do so, or if you have any questions about our data processing practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kampe.la">privacy@kampe.la</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Performance of a Contract.</b> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
  <li><b>Legal Obligations. </b>We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
  <li><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
</ul>

<p>In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this Privacy Policy, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the personal information we process as a "data processor" on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller" responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.</p>

<p><i><b>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</b></i></p>

<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</li>
  <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
  <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
  <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
  <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
  <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
  <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
  <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
  <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
  <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
  <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
  <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
</ul></p>


<h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following categories of third parties.</i></p>

<p><b>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</b> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.</p>

<p>The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Sales & Marketing Tools</li>
  <li>Ad Networks</li>
  <li>Communication & Collaboration Tools</li>
  <li>Finance & Accounting Tools </li>
  <li>Payment Processors</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
<p><ul><li><b>Business Transfers.</b>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li></ul></p>



<h2>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</i></p>

<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>

<p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>

<p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>:</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

<p>We may use Google Analytics to analyze the use of our Services, but only with your explicit consent. Your consent is the legal basis for this processing. You can revoke your consent using the pop-up banner or contacting us via <a href="mailto:privacy@kampe.la">privacy@kampe.la</a>. If you wish to have your data deleted from our Google Analytics records, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kampe.la">privacy@kampe.la</a>. Please note that we have configured our Google Analytics implementation to remove all URL query parameters, ensuring that no personally identifiable information is collected through this service.</p>


<h2>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.</i></p>

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


<h2>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i></p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>


<h2>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i></p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kampe.la">privacy@kampe.la</a>. </p>


<h2>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

<p><i><b>In Short:</b> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</i></p>

<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?" below.</p>

<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080">Member State data protection authority</a> or <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/">UK data protection authority</a>.</p>

<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a>.</p>

<p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?" below.</p>

<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

<p><b>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</b> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

<p><b>Email subscription and unsubscription practices:</b> We employ a strict double opt-in process for all our mailing lists to ensure your explicit consent. This means that after you initially sign up, we send a confirmation email requiring you to verify your subscription before adding you to any mailing list. Furthermore, every email we send includes a clear and easily accessible "Unsubscribe" link, allowing you to opt out of our communications at any time. These practices underscore our commitment to respecting your privacy choices and ensuring that you maintain control over the communications you receive from us.</p>

<p><b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. For further information, please see our <a href="/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>:</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kampe.la">privacy@kampe.la</a>.</p>


<h2>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We accept and take into account various web browser signals, including Do Not Track (DNT) signals. While there is currently no industry-wide or legal standard for recognizing or honoring these signals, we actively consider them in our data practices. We continually evaluate and adapt our approach to align with evolving standards and best practices in this area.</p>

<h3>Your Rights</h3>

<p>You have rights under certain US state data protection laws. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law. These rights include:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li><b>Right to know</b> whether or not we are processing your personal data</li>
  <li><b>Right to access</b> your personal data</li>
  <li><b>Right to correct</b> inaccuracies in your personal data</li>
  <li><b>Right to request</b> the deletion of your personal data</li>
  <li><b>Right to obtain</b> a copy of the personal data you previously shared with us</li>
  <li><b>Right to non-discrimination</b> for exercising your rights</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional privacy rights as specified by applicable state laws.</p>

<h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>

<p>To exercise these rights, you can contact us by submitting a data subject access request, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kampe.la">privacy@kampe.la</a>, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

<h3>Request Verification</h3>

<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.</p>
<p>If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kampe.la">privacy@kampe.la</a>. We will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint to your state attorney general.</p>
